  description: "I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong foundation in backend systems, distributed architecture, and cybersecurity. With hands-on experience at BolsterAI and Dell Technologies, I’ve built scalable REST APIs, integrated threat intelligence platforms, and contributed to secure multi-tenant architectures. I enjoy solving complex technical problems, whether it’s debugging memory leaks, automating typosquat detection, or integrating with enterprise tools like Microsoft Security Co-pilot. I thrive in collaborative environments, believe in ownership-driven development, and constantly seek to expand my skillset across cloud, DevOps, and AI-powered applications. I’m curious, adaptable, and always ready to build meaningful software that makes an impact.",
